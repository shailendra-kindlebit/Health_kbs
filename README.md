# Health_kbs
HealthObserver – SwiftUI HealthKit Background Sync  A production-ready SwiftUI sample app demonstrating how to observe HealthKit data changes, handle background delivery using HKObserverQuery, and securely upload health metrics to a backend server with BGTaskScheduler.
# HealthObserver – SwiftUI HealthKit Background Sync

HealthObserver is a SwiftUI iOS application that demonstrates how to observe HealthKit data changes in the background and upload health metrics securely to a backend server using `HKObserverQuery`, Background Tasks, and `URLSession` background uploads.

This project is designed as a reference implementation for developers building medical, fitness, or AI-health applications.

  * Steps
  * Heart Rate
  * Active Energy Burned
  * Body Fat %
  * Weight
  * Height
  * HRV
  * Resting Heart Rate
* Handles locked-device limitations gracefully
* Clean MVVM structure

---

## 🛠 Requirements

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shailendra-kindlebit//HealthObserver.git

## ⚙️ Background Sync Architecture

```text
HealthKit Data Update
        ↓
HKObserverQuery Triggered
        ↓
BGTaskScheduler wakes app
        ↓
Fetch latest Health data
        ↓
Create JSON payload
        ↓
Background URLSession Upload
```

---

## 🧠 How Background Upload Works

* App registers `HKObserverQuery` for required HealthKit types.
* iOS wakes the app when new Health data is added.
* A `BGProcessingTask` is scheduled.
* App fetches the latest sample and uploads it to server.
* Upload continues even if app is suspended or phone is locked.

## 📡 Sample Upload Payload

```json
{
  "id": "F3A9C9C3-1D3C-42E7-8F8E-4A2F5A83D2E9",
  "type": "HKQuantityTypeIdentifierHeartRate",
  "value": 72,
  "unit": "count/min",
  "source": "Apple Watch",
  "timestamp": 1704789200
}
```

## ⚠️ Limitations

* Health data is encrypted when the device is locked.
* Background execution time is limited by iOS.
* Requires user permission and cannot bypass Apple privacy rules.
